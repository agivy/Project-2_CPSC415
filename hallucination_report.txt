Citation: Gautier v. Pro-Football, Inc., 304 N.Y. 354, 359, 107 N.E.2d 485 (1952
Context of Citation:
New York courts have interpreted advertising and trade narrowly so as to protect journalistic, literary, and artistic freedom.
Accordingly, if a person brings a claim against a documentary filmmaker for the use of their image in the documentary, the claim would likely fail because a documentary is not deemed produced for the purposes of advertising or trade.
See Gautier v. Pro-Football, Inc., 304 N.Y. 354, 359, 107 N.E.2d 485 (1952) (holding that a football player’s image was not used for trade or advertising when it appeared in a newsreel of a football game).
Similarly, a claim brought against a journalist for the use of a person’s image in an article about a matter of public interest would also likely fail.

Citation: In Candelaria v. Spurlock, the plaintiff appeared briefly in the documentary Super Size Me. The plaintiff did not allege that his appearance was for advertising or trade. The plaintiff did, however, allege that a hidden camera captured his image. The court held that the plaintiff’s appearance was newsworthy because the film was about the health effects of eating McDonald’s food. Further, the court held, there was a real relationship between the plaintiff’s image and the film because the plaintiff was a McDonald’s employee and the film’s star was a McDonald’s customer.
